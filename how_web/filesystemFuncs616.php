<p>Most of these functions will be quite familiar to Unix users, as they closely replicate
common system commands.</p>

<p>Caution: Many of the functions in this section are dangerous. Because they duplicate
functions that can and should be performed from the local system, they can be a cracker's
bonanza without providing much value to legitimate users. Strongly consider disabling them
using PHP's disable_functions directive (as discussed in the preceding section on file
writing)!</p>

<p>The one piece of good news is that some of these functions will only work if the PHP
process is running as the superuser. Because this is not the default case in the Web browser,
presumably these functions are intended to be used by the scripting version of PHP, and only
trusted users who know what they're doing are even in a position to shoot themselves in the
foot this way. Of course, if you are foolish enough to run your Web server as root, you are
doubly screwed.</p>

<p>The most common and safest functions are listed first in the following sections; the less
common and less safe are in Table 23-1.</p>

<h2>feof</h2>

<p>The feof function tests for end-of-file on a file pointer and takes a filename as argument.
It's used mostly in a while loop to perform the same function on each line in a file:</p>

<pre>
while (!feof(&#36;fd)) {
  &#36;line = fgets(&#36;fd, 4096);
  echo &#36;line;
}
</pre>

<h2>file_exists</h2>

<p>The file_exists function is a simple function you will use again and again if you use
filesystem functions at all. It simply checks the local filesystem for a file of the
specified name.</p>

<pre>
if (!file_exists("testfile.php")) {
  &#36;fd = fopen("testfile.php", "w+");
}
</pre>

<p>The function returns true if the file exists, false if not found. The results of this
test are stored in a cache, which may be cleared by use of the function clearstatcache().</p>

<h2>filesize</h2>

<p>Another simple but useful function is filesize, which returns and caches the size of a
file in bytes. We use it in all the fread() examples earlier in this chapter. Never pass in a
filesize as an integer if you can do it by using filesize() instead.</p>
